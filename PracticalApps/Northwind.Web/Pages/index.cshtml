    @*
    When you define properties in a @fucntions block, you are adding 
    code to an automatically generated class named Pages_<razorpagename>.
    In this case the class name would be Pages_index. The class is 
    automatically given a property named Model that represents itself. 
    You can use DayName, this.DayName or Model. Dayname to refer to the 
    property in the code or in the HTML markup
